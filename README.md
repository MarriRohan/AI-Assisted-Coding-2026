# AI-Assisted-Coding-2026
COURSE SUMMARY
 AI Assisted Coding helps the students to gain knowledge on various AI tools which helps in code generation, bug fix, test case generation, code explaination and code review etc. This course helps the students to complete project from code genartion to document preparation using AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Cursor AI etc.

COURSE-SPECIFIC LEARNING OUTCOMES (CO)

By the end of this program, students should have the following knowledge, skills and values:

CO1: Apply AI coding tools such as GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and Cursor AI for efficient code generation, debugging, and documentation across different programming tasks.

CO2: Develop and manage software components using prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting strategies for improved AI output.

CO3: Design and implement full-stack applications—comprising frontend, backend, and database layers—using AI assistance for code development, integration, and testing.

CO4: Evaluate AI-generated code for quality, performance, security, and ethical compliance, and demonstrate the ability to collaborate using version control and AI-assisted pair programming tools.
